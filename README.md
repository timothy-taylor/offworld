Offworld is a Tone.JS based granular synthesizer that allows manipulation of 
an audio buffer using image data. It was originally created as the final 
project for The Odin Project Javascript course. Since it has improved quite 
a bit with user saving/load preset functionality, better mobile and 
touchscreen experience (though still not perfect), and general code 
improvements under the hood.
