Offworld is a Tone.JS based granular synthesizer that allows manipulation of 
an audio buffer using image data. It was originally created as the final 
project for The Odin Project Javascript course. 

New dev branch is adding functionality: users can signup/login and save 
their media files.

Built with Vite, React, Supabase, Jotai, HTML5, and TailwindCSS.
